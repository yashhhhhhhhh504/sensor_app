# Landmark Recognition using TensorFlow

This repository contains the source code for a deep learningâ€“based landmark recognition system built with TensorFlow. The project covers the full pipeline from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and inference, and is designed with modularity and ease-of-use in mind.


## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a robust landmark recognition model using TensorFlow. By processing images of various landmarks, the system is trained to identify and classify landmarks accurately. This repository is designed for developers and researchers who wish to experiment with deep learning techniques in the domain of image recognition.

## Features

- **TensorFlow Model:** Leverages TensorFlow 2.x for building and training deep learning models.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes scripts for image augmentation, normalization, and organization.
- **Modular Codebase:** Separate modules for training (`train.py`), evaluation (`evaluate.py`), and inference (`app.py`).
- **Custom Configuration:** Easily modify hyperparameters, dataset paths, and other settings via the configuration file.
- **Code Editor Friendly:** Detailed comments and clear structure make it easy to understand, modify, and debug.
